get comfortable with command line (specifically: ls, cd)

get npm and node prepared

update node to latest version


follow installation here:
https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html

- note that commands given didn't work until I started typing sudo right before them

- after it's all installed and ready, navigate into your app folder and type:
npm start


not clear where to put code from hello world example from here:
https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html

first tried App.js
then tried index.js

index.js worked, but it overwrote the app component because it was writing hello world to the same div (id="root")

so where is that html file with that "root" div?
I have no idea.

Let's keep going and see if the tutorial gives any help.

Also it might be weird for people to see html in js but I had seen jsx before, so I wasn't lost in that part.

On a whim, tried putting together App and hello world like this:

ReactDOM.render(
	<App /><h1>Hello world!</h1>,
	document.getElementById('root')
);

... but it caused an error because apparently if you put two tags next to each other in React, you need to put them inside a containing element, so I did this and it worked:

ReactDOM.render(
	<div>
		<App />
		<h1>Hello world!</h1>
	</div>,
	document.getElementById('root')
);

Tested <App> without trailing slash and it caused an error. In JSX, unlike html, there needs to be a slash in the tag if it's a self-closing tag.

Interesting note: JSX tags use className instead of class (understandably since class is already used in js)


looked at this page:
https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/introducing-jsx.html

pretty cool that you can put JS expressions in curly braces in the JSX

tried to jump ahead and use styles
- found a good error message, but need to go back and learn properly how JSX wants the styles to be


- jsx turns these weird-looking HTMLish expressions into objects
- actually: babel compiles jsx down to React.createElement() calls
