import

	if import sees a plain string, it automatically looks in node_modules

	if you want something different, you need to specify the path
		if you don't use an extension, it will assume the file is .js




export

	"export default" defines what gets exported when you write:
		import Whatever from 'whatever';

	you can also have named exports that get called like this:
		import {render} from 'react-dom';




jsx

	remember to use className for html classes in jsx

	single tags need closing slashes in jsx

	comments need to look like this inside jsx
		{/* text here */}
		Also, they can't go outside the containing element
