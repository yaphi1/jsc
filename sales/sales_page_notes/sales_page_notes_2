*[winner]* Confession: I struggled to learn JavaScript
- I finally learned JavaScript and got a $60,000 salary boost
- I know how it feels to struggle with JavaScript



start off with intro

I learned JavaScript the worst way possible.

With random tutorials and projects, I had no direction, lots of confusion, incomplete understanding, lots of forgetting, and feelings of hopelessness.

I struggled so much that I had to relearn JavaScript about five times.  That was frustrating.

When I finally got it, I realized I didn't have to struggle the way i did.  There were certain key ingredients that could have helped me learn much faster, but I didn't discover them until it was too late.

To test my theories about learning, I tried helping my friends who were struggling with JavaScript.

With my help, they learned more in the first two afternoons than they had in the past year.

At that point, I realized I could help a lot of people get similar results.

I put together a JavaScript course, so that no one would have to waste time the way I did.





Before I tell you about the course, here are three ways learning JavaScript can improve your life:

1. You'll have more freedom to create what you want.
2. More jobs will be open to you (and better quality ones too).
3. Knowing JavaScript can add an extra $10,000 to $70,000 onto your salary.  (My personal experience was towards the upper range of this.)

Now for the course.

Simple Steps JavaScript

Simple Steps JavaScript is a course designed to help you learn JavaScript while avoiding all the mistakes I and so many others have made.

Benefits you'll get from this course:

no fluff
sub-point: lots of instructors try too hard for completeness, end up with confusion

no marathon examples that span chapters

this course actually cares about getting you to remember it (not just dumping info and letting you forget it) (lots of other courses race you through a ton of material so they can say they covered it)

bite-sized pieces - more fun, easier to find time, easier to digest

practical - stuff you can use right away (you don’t have to wait 6 chapters to write your first code) (also this path through javascript balances fundamentals with fun stuff in a way that lets you accomplish real things faster)

real life practice - a lot of courses have you practice on their site which is good for convenience, but then people say they can’t apply the stuff in real life.  This course gets you to apply your knowledge all along.

flexibility - the written format means updates can be made easier than videos or books (this means bonus content can be added so the value of this will grow)

convenience - your time, your schedule, small pieces at a time

value - much better than going into debt and getting questionable results; also better than free options because you commit more to something you’ve paid for


categories:
- you won't get confused
- it's practical
- you'll remember it
- you'll be able to apply it in real life
- it fits into your schedule




What's inside?

Online course - 25 chapters of written content
Code examples, clear explanations, practice drills, portfolio projects, tips about common mistakes to avoid
