pain points: what do people struggle with? why haven't they learned js? if they've tried, what have been the problems?

- trouble staying motivated
- so many options... am i learning correctly? how do I know what to learn and what to avoid
- don't know where or how to start (overwhelmed by where to start) or what to learn next
- try a bunch of things feel scattered; i go on learning binges every now and then, but since I don't apply it, I tend to forget it
- how to find good practice projects (some sound simple but turn out to be hard and discouraging)
- when i follow examples i can do it, but when i try it myself i draw a blank
- i understand the concepts, but it's hard to put them together
- trouble finding time (do I need to dedicate 8 hours per day to this)
- understand it now, but forget it soon so you need to keep backtracking and it takes forever
- there's so much material and it's hard to remember


course benefits:

- short sections (find time, stay motivated, remember better, and have fun)
- clear explanations (I know your struggles because I went through them too, so I can explain stuff from the perspective of an actual learner rather than an out-of-touch "expert")
- practical usefulness so you see the results of your work right away (no more waiting until chapter 15 to show stuff on the screen); maximum amount of practical usefulness in minimum amount of time
- you'll actually remember this stuff (the course is built to make the basics feel automatic, so you won't have trouble later on)
- you won't freeze when you have to apply this in real life because the practice in this course is structured to match real life
- you'll have a direct learning path so you won't feel scattered and lost
- you'll get mini practice projects when you're ready for them so you won't feel discouraged


javascript benefits:
- freedom to create what you want
- more jobs and better ones too
- $10,000 to $70,000 boost in salary
