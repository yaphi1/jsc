Confession: I struggled to learn JavaScript

How many of these statements sound familiar to you?

- I want to learn JavaScript, but it's hard to find time.
- There are so many learning options.  Am I learning correctly?  How do I know what to learn and what to avoid?
- I don't even know where to start.
- I try a bunch of things, but I feel scattered. I go on learning binges every now and then, but since I don't apply it, I tend to forget it.
- How do I find good practice projects? The ones I've tried sound simple, but they turn out to be hard and discouraging.
- When i follow examples i can do it, but when i try it myself i draw a blank.
- I understand the concepts, but it's hard to put them together.
- I keep forgetting earlier concepts, so I can't learn anything new because I'm constantly backtracking.
- There's so much material and it's hard to remember.

I've dealt with all of these things.
