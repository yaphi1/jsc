launch 3 notes



paypal was a good addition


next time, use mailchimp groups to simplify workflow and see connections better; having a separate list is getting out of hand


all or most early purchasers were people who had gotten on the list within the past week or so
	- possibilities:
		- when they sign up for the email list, they need a solution now, and if they have to wait, they'll do something else
		- maybe the past list members haven't been engaged enough
		- past list members might have been conditioned for previous (lower) prices

consider revamping homepage to be about js instead (nah)

change copy to target people who are more like your paying customers (instead of getting a job; make it about either changing your job or boosting your skills in your current job)
