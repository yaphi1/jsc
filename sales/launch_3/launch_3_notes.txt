launch 3 notes



paypal was a good addition


next time, use mailchimp groups to simplify workflow and see connections better; having a separate list is getting out of hand


all or most early purchasers were people who had gotten on the list within the past week or so
	- possibilities:
		- when they sign up for the email list, they need a solution now, and if they have to wait, they'll do something else
		- maybe the past list members haven't been engaged enough
		- past list members might have been conditioned for previous (lower) prices

consider revamping homepage to be about js instead (nah)

change copy to target people who are more like your paying customers (instead of getting a job; make it about either changing your job or boosting your skills in your current job)

Lessons:

- Adding paypal was a great idea (nearly 40% of purchases came from there).

- Raising the price helped not only with revenue but also in the way people respected the material.

- Incorporating feedback from previous launches had fantastic results (e.g.: clarifying parts where people wanted more detail, addressing doubts, etc).

- Having a separate mailchimp list for customers proved to be a pain.  Lists aren't aware of each other in mailchimp, so I had to manually indicate which people from my original list had become customers so I wouldn't keep sending them sales emails.  Also, having the same person in two lists means I have to pay twice for those people.  I might experiment with mailchimp groups instead.  Not sure if that will solve my issues, but it seems like a promising route.

- Progress has been decent.  Launch 1 was $1000, Launch 2 was $1400, and now Launch 3 is $3000. (Each launch was 5-6 months apart.)

- I did a week and a half launch, which was nice (Wednesday through Friday).  It gave more people a chance to get the course and made it less likely that they'd be away while the course was open.  It also gave me a chance to space the emails out a bit to avoid being overwhelming.  I sold more this time, and I dropped fewer subscribers this time too.

- The best-performing emails had personal stories that led into brief descriptions of features in a way that directly addressed the audience's burning pains.

- Nearly half of the customers purchased at the very beginning and half at the end.  Few in the middle.  The ones who purchased at the beginning had just gotten onto my email list recently (like within the past week or two).  The ones who purchased near the end of the sales period had generally been on the list for a while.  These findings suggest there's a significant number of people who are looking for a solution right away and might try something else if the product doesn't present itself quickly.
	(note this is about 10 people of about 200 recent subs, so the list-to-sale conversion rate is about 5% in the first two weeks)
