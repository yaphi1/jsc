[ZTL M4 insights - Might be able to 7X revenue without more traffic, higher prices, copy changes, or any new products]

I've read the first chapter of Jay Abraham's book so far (thanks for the recommendation, Matteo), and I've started examining my funnel in more depth.
.
Over the past 3 launches, I've done the following:
- talked to customers
- tweaked copy
- addressed objections and doubts
- started getting compliments about the sales page copy
- watched revenue go up
- saw returns drop to zero
.
Next I sent a survey to see why people didn't buy, and the main reasons were:
- would like to, but genuinely can't pay
- already in the middle of another course
- not at the right level (too beginner or too advanced)
.
For the people who can pay and would buy the course, the number one issue is timing. In other markets, timing is just an excuse, but in mine, it's often the difference between getting my course and going elsewhere.
.
After looking through my data, I noticed that people who got on the list within a week or two before the launch were 10X as likely to buy!

This suggests that people who get on my list are looking for my course's solution immediately, and if the launch doesn't happen soon enough, they find a course elsewhere.

With earlier launches, I can jump from 0.7% list-to-sale conversions to 5%, a 7X improvement. If I had done that before, the $3,000 launch would have translated to $21,000.

This also seems consistent with Graham's findings in his GrowthLab post (http://growthlab.com/how-i-increased-my-monthly-income-44-without-launching-a-new-product/).
.
.
Here's my plan now:

- Have an automated mini-launch for each new subscriber, complete with a custom countdown timer on the sales page (I have a way to make this happen)
- Be 100% honest and transparent with customers about why the timer is there

- Start by testing for 4 weeks to see if conversion rate really is around 5%.
- If it looks decent, keep the test going.

I'll report back with results.
