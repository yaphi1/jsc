The real cost of copying and pasting code



Before I knew JavaScript, I used to depend on copied and pasted code to create anything interactive.

I thought this was a shortcut, but it wasn't at all.

When I wanted to do one thing, I'd have to spend hours searching the web and reading through instructions to find the perfect code snippet for my purposes.

Then when the code snippet didn't do quite what I wanted, I'd spend more hours or even days figuring out how to tweak it.

Once I sat down and learned JavaScript, I realized the so-called shortcut of copying and pasting actually cost me more time than learning the language.

After learning JavaScript, the things that would take me hours or days were now getting done in minutes.

Even better, the things I coded would work exactly the way I wanted them to.  It felt good not to deal with code snippets that were inflexible or a bad fit.

I didn't even learn JavaScript efficiently, and it was still better than copying and pasting stuff.

Still, I would have liked to avoid the wrong turns I made while learning JavaScript.

For that reason, I went ahead and created the course I wish had when I was starting out.

Feel free to take a look at the course here.

Best,
