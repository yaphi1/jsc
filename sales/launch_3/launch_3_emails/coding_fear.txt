Something that bothers coders but no one talks about


Recently, a reader sent a very honest message about an important topic.

I've reprinted it here with permission:

"I'm afraid to create, and this sound so dumb for me because the purpose I wanted to learn JS, CSS, HTML (Front-End Design) is for me to be able to create things and for me be able to get my dream Job and I want to help other trough frontend design. But after this years of learning it seems that it isn't enough. I'm afraid that the things I will create will suck at the end."


parts

1) worry about throwing away a lot of time for a bad result
2) feeling doubt about one's abilities
3) fear of falling behind or not knowing enough
4) fear of judgement from others


how to solve

1
recreate small things you like; this limits time and guarantees you'll like the result

2
more stuff you create, the more you can point to when doubts start to appear

3
get better at html, css, and js; get better at everything

4
everyone makes mistakes; it's okay
