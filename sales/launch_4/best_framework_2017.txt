What's the best JavaScript framework to learn in 2017?



Web development can sound crazy these days.

It seems like there's so much to know before you can do anything.

So out of all the frameworks, what's the best one to learn in 2017?

Trick question.

Get better at JavaScript.

Since the JavaScript tools and frameworks are based around JavaScript, this one language will make you better at all of them by default.

If you improve your JavaScript, you'll automatically be better at React, Angular, jQuery, Node, Express, Socket io, Gulp, API usage, AJAX, JSON, Vue, and a whole host of other things, all at once.

That's a really good use of your time!

It's kind of like if you know a human language, you can read a whole bunch of books in that language, but if you don't know the language and you try to read a book, you'll waste tons of time trying to understand the symbols in front of you.

So if you try to learn a JavaScript framework before getting comfortable with JavaScript, you'll end up putting in more time AND getting worse results!

Now that it's clear why JavaScript is a good thing to learn, here are two things I'd recommend:

1) If you'd like to get comfortable doing practical things with JavaScript, I've created a course for you. This course is based on years of listening to why people struggle with other courses and addressing those problems.

2) If you look through the course details and it's all stuff you know already, then I recommend going on codewars and doing their practice problems (really fun and a great way to improve).

Once you're comfortable with JavaScript, you can pick up a framework or tool in a couple of afternoons.

I hope this has been helpful, and in the upcoming emails, we're going to cover animations, APIs, and learning tips.
