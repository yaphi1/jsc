I've answered some questions you might have



I wanted to answer some common questions about the new JavaScript course before it closes tomorrow night.

The course is called [Simple Steps JavaScript], and its purpose is to train you to do practical things with JavaScript while avoiding the traps too many learners fall into.

The reason this course closes tomorrow night is to help you make a decision.  One of the biggest reasons people fail to learn JavaScript is procrastination.  They say, "I'll do it tomorrow," and tomorrow turns into never.  People who succeed don't wait.


Q: Is the course right for me?
A: The course is right for you if you know enough HTML and CSS to style a div or a span using a class or an id, and you want to learn JavaScript.

Q: But what if I already know some JavaScript?
A: That's fine! The course will help you solidify the parts you know while guiding you into the things you don't.  However, the course is NOT right for you if you're already comfortable using all of the following JavaScript concepts: arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, loops, functions, variables, booleans, dates, timing, click events, keyboard events, input validation, regex, and the console.

Q: How will this course fit into my schedule?
A: The course is structured in small, convenient pieces that you can whenever it's convenient for you.  Once you get the course, you'll have lifetime access, so you can take it at your own pace and refer back to it whenever you want.

Q: What if I'm not happy with the course?
A: Just ask for a refund and include one line of code you wrote so I at least know you tried.  You have 60 days to get a 100% refund, and I'll personally pay the credit card processing fees.  I'm confident about the material, so please only join the course if you're prepared to act on it.  I want to see you win.


TL;DR

The course, Simple Steps JavaScript, closes at 11:59pm Friday night.  If you intend to learn JavaScript, I suggest checking it out.  If not, now is the time to make that decision.
