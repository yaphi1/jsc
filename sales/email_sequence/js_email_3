How much more could you make by learning JavaScript?

Let's say you know HTML and CSS.  How much more would you be able to make if you knew JavaScript?

That's kind of a trick question because it's really two questions:

1) How much can you make when you know JavaScript?
2) How much can you make without JavaScript?

Question 1 is relatively easy to answer with a quick search of "JavaScript salaries."

Question 2 is trickier because many of the salaries involving HTML and CSS also involve JavaScript.  Another thing that makes it harder to answer is that not knowing JavaScript excludes you from a lot of developer jobs, meaning that you have to look at other job types to get an accurate comparison.

Fortunately, I have some reasonable estimates based on experience and research (inside the United States, at least).

For those who know HTML and CSS but not JavaScript, the salaries tend to land in the $30,000 to $50,000 range.

For those who know JavaScript, a lot of the salaries tend to range from $70,000 to $130,000.  Some are higher.

In any case, adding JavaScript to your arsenal appears to increase your salary potential by at least $10,000, and often far more.  JavaScript also gives you more job opportunities and more freedom to create what you want on the web.

Based on this info, it's clear that learning JavaScript is valuable for anyone who wants to do web development.

The only problem is that people who try to learn JavaScript often go about it the wrong way.

A lack of direction leads to incomplete understanding, which leads to confusion, frustration, and feeling like you're going in circles.  I know because I've seen it happen to a lot of people, including me.

When I finally felt comfortable with JavaScript, I noticed ways I could have learned much more efficiently.  I tested my theories with my friends who were learning JavaScript, and they learned more in the first few days than they had in the entire past year.

That was when I realized I could help a lot of people.

I created a course called Simple Steps JavaScript to help people avoid the mistakes I and so many others had made.  It was a ton of work to create, but I wanted to make sure you're getting top quality material.

Introducing Simple Steps JavaScript

When people struggle with JavaScript, their reasons generally fall into one of a few categories.

- They're not sure what direction to take.
- They try to learn too much at once, and they forget everything.
- They don't practice applying their skills, so they can't do anything with what they've learned.
- They spend too much time reading about JavaScript and not enough time actually typing code.
- They take on overwhelming projects and give up.

I created a JavaScript course to save you from their fate.

If you'd like to learn JavaScript now instead of struggling fruitlessly for another year, here's the course:

The course will close the day after tomorrow, so if you want to learn JavaScript, now's the time to take action.

P.S.: At this point, it's very easy to say "That sounds nice. I should try that," and then never actually do it.  You have the opportunity to break that cycle.  Here's the course again:
