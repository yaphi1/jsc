algorithm patterns


greedy algorithm approach:
- try to walk through once, finding best answer so far
- what other values do we need to keep updated in order to maintain the best answer so far?



when in doubt, try a hash map (think it's constant, but check time complexity)



when unsure, write out naive solution and look for repeated steps to eliminate



sometimes walk through a problem once forwards and once backwards
