In terms of entire pitching to published process, it goes like this:

1. Research who you’re pitching (anywhere from 15 min to 2 hours, depending on how “big” they are and how familiar you are with their work at this point).
2. Pitch ->
3. Hear back (0 to 2 days, if not float to top of inbox in 7 days) ->
4. 1-2 emails nailing down specifics for you to start writing ->
5. Have your draft to them in a week or two ->
6. They publish it in a week or two after that.
