hand-code ____ in svg
(tie-in to svg book)


draft letter:


I hope all's well!

I'm planning to make a post on my site featuring a collection of front-end portfolio project ideas from the experts.

I figured I'd reach out to you to see if you'd be willing to suggest one project idea for people who are learning front-end web development (more would be great too, but I'd be thrilled with even one).

Since I'd like this to take as little of your time as possible, here are some fill-in-the-blanks answers you can use if you'd like:

- Hand-code [something] in SVG.
- Re-create [cool CodePen demo]
- Build a [common UI component]
- Look at [website] for inspiration

Ideally this will be beneficial for the readers (a very popular question is being answered) and for the contributors (cross-pollination of audiences).

I plan to tie in a link to whatever you'd like (your SVG book, for example), so let me know if this sounds good!

Best,

Yaphi
