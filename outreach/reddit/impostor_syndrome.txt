first identify source of problems:

- can't know everything
- each person suggests you need to know a couple of things
	- you put that together and feel like you need to be an expert in all of it to even get your foot in the door
- the more you know, the more you realize you don't know
- it's easy for someone to read something new, talk about it the next day, and you're lost and you feel like you have no idea what's going on
- everyone knows different things, so when you hear all of those different things, it's easy to feel like you're supposed to know all of them


fix the problems:
- realize it happens to almost everyone regardless of skill level
- build concrete stuff and show it in places like codepen
- practice raw js (brings skills and confidence while also preparing for multiple frameworks at once)
- when you don't know something, treat it as a good thing; if you knew everything, it would be so boring
