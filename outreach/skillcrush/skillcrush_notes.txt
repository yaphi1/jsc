pitch:

Hi everyone at Skillcrush,

As a front-end developer, I'm a huge fan of the posts on the Skillcrush blog since they have a friendly tone, and they're very practical.

I'd love to write a guest article on Skillcrush, and I wanted to know if any of these topics would resonate with your audience:

1) The Phrase that Strangles Your Coding Career

Summary: People often tell themselves "I'm not a [fill-in-the-blank] person," where the blank could be "tech" or "interview" for example. The article would discuss how this holds people back and concrete steps to get past this problem.

2) 5 Traps to Avoid when Learning Web Development

Summary: Traps might include chasing frameworks instead of fundamentals, attempting large projects too early, going slower by rushing, and more.

3) 5 Ways to Get Unstuck when Learning JavaScript

Summary: Tricks would include things like writing out your logic in plain language before attempting a project, testing small pieces and logging the results, identifying whether the issue is syntax or logic, and more.
