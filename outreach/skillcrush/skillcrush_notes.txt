- easy hacks to sound better in javascript interviews (validate input, name things clearly and mention maintainability [show that you care about the next person], couch your decisions in what they mean for the business, show concern for the user experience, lay out all info and assumptions you have [shows clear thinking, helps think easier, etc], talk out loud, get specific about what you're unsure of, don't be afraid to ask questions [try to narrow it down first and be specific])
- traps learners fall into
- how to get unstuck when learning javascript
