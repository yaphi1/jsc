Are you overcomplicating your own learning?



Learning a new concept can be tricky, especially when you sabotage yourself.

Here's how it happens:

Quickly learn about A.
Quickly learn about B.
Learn about C, which builds on A and B.
Wait, I don't remember A.
Ok so I'm going to go back and look at A.
Now I've forgotten B.
What was C again?
C seems useful, but it's like a house of cards in my head trying to stack up A, B, and C together.
This whole subject is too complicated.
Maybe I'll try it later.
6 months pass with no action.
I tried, but it was too difficult. Maybe some other time.

What you end up thinking:
Item C is too complicated.

The truth:
Item C is not complicated. It just felt that way because you were trying to learn C while 80% of your brain was distracted trying to remember/learn A and remember/learn B.

The solution:
Get comfortable with one thing at a time. If you find yourself having to remember/learn B while you're on C, then try going back to B and getting comfortable with it. Sometimes that can take as little as a few focused minutes.

Everything will be much easier.
