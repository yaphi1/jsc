when people sign up with joke info



One of my favorite things is when someone signs up for an email list with a joking name.

I do it all the time.

This leads to emails beginning like this:

"Hi [insert embarrassing words here]"

Fantastic.

Naturally, I sign up for stuff with a separate, dedicated email address just for signing up for things.

Over time, something interesting has happened.

I've started looking forward to my fake email inbox more than my real one.

Werid, right?

It kind of makes sense though.

When I sign up for email lists, usually it's because they have info I really want, presented in a way that will be directly useful and relevant to me.

Their entire businesses depend on being interesting and relevant to me, so it makes sense that they would send helpful emails.

Why does this matter to you?

Because thinking about the user experience is one of the keys to succeeding at a lot of things.

Whether you're creating a website, pitching an idea, or applying for a job, you're creating an experience for the person you're talking to.

When you think about the experience you're giving people, here are some things to think about (and ask them about directly):

- What are their needs, goals, hopes, fears, etc?
- What are their doubts and questions?
- What are some things that have frustrated them in the past?
- What do they want out of this interaction?

So many big companies forget to ask these types of questions, and they lose embarrassing amounts of sales as a result.

Many people fail to do this as well, and they miss out on all sorts of opportunities.

When you think about your audience's needs first, you'll end up with:

- More effective websites
- Better jobs and salaries
- More respect as a professional
- Ideas getting listened to more

Try it out, and let me know if you have any stories about this approach.

I read every response. :)
