------------------

notes from call:


three revenue multipliers:
	- average order value
	- purchase frequency
	- number of clients


increase AOV:
	- add upsell
	- add another tier




from traffic vault:
- write about others
- get ideas from your customers
- track your competitors
- help subscribers 1-on-1 and create case studies
- become a regular on forums


suggestions from primoz and marc:
- consider podcasts
- summits (events, etc): try to be a guest
- ask for introductions from subscribers
- try video interviews


next steps:
- increase traffic (this has no ceiling compared to other methods)
	- maybe consider lifehacker again
- add upsell
- add new tier
- maybe change price (there's elasticity there, so try to get it down to between 0.5% to 1%)
- see what other course sellers are doing
- maybe change blurb to js (on sitepoint)



another question for later:
	- how to balance timing with launch windows
	- urgency creates more sales, but also there were a lot of people telling me they wanted the course but just were away that week when it came out
	- consider lifetime guarantee to help with timing
