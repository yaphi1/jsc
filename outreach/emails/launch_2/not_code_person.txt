When people say they're "not a code person..."





not a code person


not a ____ person

no one is born learning how to code

everyone just looks at what's on the outside and thinks it's automatic for other people

lots of times people who are good discount the things that prepared them (because it's normal and blends into the background)

once you realize you have more control over your skills than most people know, you find out what you thought was some sort of innate ability or impossible achievement is really just simple steps
