One of the easiest things you can do to get better at JavaScript




Here's one of my favorite ways to get better at JavaScript, or any coding language in general.

When I learn something new, I type it repeatedly a few times so it starts to feel automatic.

Here are the reasons I like that approach:

- It's easy
- A few extra minutes now can save many hours later
- When the code starts to feel automatic, you can focus on solving problems and creating cool things instead of worrying about that semicolon






easiest way to get comfortable with code (repeat a few times until automatic)
