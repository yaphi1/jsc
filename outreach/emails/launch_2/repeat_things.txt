One of the easiest things you can do to get better at JavaScript




Hi *|FNAME|*,

Here's one of my favorite ways to get better at JavaScript or any coding language in general.

When I learn something new, I type it repeatedly a few times so it starts to feel automatic.  That's it.

Here are the reasons I like that approach:

- It's easy, and it makes you comfortable with a new thing very quickly.

- A few extra minutes now can save many hours later.  For a lot of people, that extra momentum that can mean the difference between succeeding and giving up.

- When the code starts to feel automatic, you can focus on solving problems and creating cool things instead of worrying about whether you put that semicolon in the right place.

- You start to feel like a wizard at this stuff, and that feeling helps you make even more progress.

I hope this helps!

Best,

Yaphi
