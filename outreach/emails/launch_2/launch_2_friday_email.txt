Does this sound familiar to you?




Hi *|FNAME|*,

If you're interested in learning JavaScript, I suggest you read this before 11:59pm tonight because that's when the course sign-up closes for Simple Steps JavaScript.

Do any of the following statements sound familiar?

"I want to learn JavaScript, but I feel overwhelmed."
"The stuff makes sense as I'm learning, but I can't really apply it or put it together afterwards."
"I can never remember the stuff I learn."
"I'd like to learn JavaScript, but I can't find the time."
"I try to follow along with tutorials, but I get lost."
"When am I going to be able to do ____?  How do I get there?"
"I try to learn by doing a simple project, but I get hopelessly lost and give up."
“People seem to expect you to figure it out on your own.”

For too many JavaScript learners, these statements are a reality.

In the face of such challenges, there are two ways to go:

1) Change nothing, and keep getting the same results.

2) Take a different approach, and succeed faster.

Unlike lots of other courses, Simple Steps JavaScript was designed so you would not just learn JavaScript, but actually remember it and be able to apply it.

The key to this method is that I'd rather tell you one thing at a time and have you remember it than ten things and have you forget all of them.

Anyways, the course closes tonight at 11:59pm, so if you want to learn JavaScript, now is the time.
