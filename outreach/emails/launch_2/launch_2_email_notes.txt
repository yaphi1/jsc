possible email topics:



* - when people say they're "not a code person"

* - (the things people tell me about JavaScript courses) problem with other course formats
	[possibly same topic] - what the doubters say whenever I say I have a JS course (vs people who have seen the course)

* - what sounds simple isn't always; problem with making a quiz and other too big projects
	[possibly same topic] - why people struggle with JS

* - frequently asked questions

* - course open again after 6 months

- which frameworks vs timeless js (maybe not)

* - special stuff and shiny tactics vs what works

* - copying and pasting code (actually takes longer than learning)

- what sounds complicated can be broken into simple steps

- a personal story and the key to understanding anything

- repetition: the easiest thing you can do to learn js (like typing; can focus on message instead of where the "a" key is)
