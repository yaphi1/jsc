Simple Steps JavaScript is finally open for sign-ups again






After about half a year, Simple Steps JavaScript is finally open for sign-ups again.

If you're interested in learning JavaScript, actually remembering it, and being able to do practical things quickly, feel free to see what the course is all about.

If you have any questions about the course (and they aren't already answered on the page), go ahead and to reply directly to this email. I will personally answer. :)

Best,
