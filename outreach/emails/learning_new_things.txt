If you ever feel stuck when you're learning something, you might enjoy this email.

Recently I was trying to learn something new.  It was taking a while, and I caught myself thinking "If this is how long it takes, am I ever going to be able to do it?"

So I took a deeper look at that thought.  Why did I suddenly feel this way?  Shouldn't I just break the problem down into simple steps and keep going?

Well, yes, but that didn't change how I felt about it.  Why?

To solve this mystery, I had to go deeper.

I thought about my daily routine.  These days, I spend a lot of time doing things I already know how to do.  I write about topics I'm comfortable with, and I code things I already know how to code.  I've gotten too comfortable in my comfort zone.

I didn't realize this until I stumbled across a bunch of articles about how top performers become the best.  Then I found the answer I was looking for.

Champions don't get that way by doing what's comfortable.  They get good by consistently and deliberately practicing new, challenging things.  They get used to feeling like a beginner, struggling to improve instead of settling into the comfort of doing what's familiar.

That's how they improve very fast.

That's how they leave everyone else in the dust.

The point?

When you're struggling with a new concept, that's not a bad thing.  In fact it's one of the biggest signs that you're going in the right direction.

Best,
