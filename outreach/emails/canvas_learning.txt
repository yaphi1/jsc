Something in web development took me an embarrassingly long time...





message:


A while ago, I saw people creating really cool graphical effects with the canvas element.

I decided I wanted to learn to do that too.

It took me a staggering two years to learn the basics of canvas even though I was already comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Why?

Simple.  Most of that time, I didn't actually take a single step to even try.

After two years, I decided to start learning it, and it took one weekend.

That's it.

After all that time of not doing anything, one weekend of effort was all it took.

By the end of that weekend, it wasn't just the basics I had learned; I had built a fully functioning game of glowing space pong.

That experience reinforced a point I had seen in a lot of situations:
Most of the time it takes to do something is the time spent not actually doing it.

Obviously this isn't true in all cases, but it's a good reminder that helps put things in perspective, especially when there's something you want to do but haven't done yet.

Anyways, I hope this email is helpful!

Best,
