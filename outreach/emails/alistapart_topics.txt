avoid getting wrecked by third-party code
- examples of what can happen (variable overwritten, site breaks, allows script injection on card pages, makes site slow or janky, large amounts of unnecessary code)
- ask about the purpose (might reveal it was unnecessary or duplicated)
- check their website for errors
- run it in console and check for console errors
- look at how they send the code (if it's in a word doc, that's a red flag)
- don't assume big famous companies are immune
- look for red flags in code (document.write, eval, etc)
- does it slow everything down
- how are the companies treating you (for example, shady things like removing key people from emails)
- if it's a script, can you host it on your site? (otherwise it can change and break stuff)
- does it create global variables? (potentially interfere with your stuff although you should avoid that in a lot of cases)
- is it a huge thing for a small function?


how to know when you're good enough
- issues: people say things that make you feel like you're not good enough; info comes out that makes you think you don't know what's going on
- treatment: building things
- mindset shift: instead of worrying about knowing everything, be excited by what you've done and what there still is left to learn
