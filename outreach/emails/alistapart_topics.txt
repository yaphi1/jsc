a list apart topics




avoid getting wrecked by third-party code [note there's already an article about third-party code, so this might have to go into technical details rather than business considerations]
- examples of what can happen (variable overwritten, site breaks, allows script injection on card pages, makes site slow or janky, large amounts of unnecessary code)
- ask about the purpose (might reveal it was unnecessary or duplicated)
- check their website for errors
- run it in console and check for console errors
- look at how they send the code (if it's in a word doc, that's a red flag)
- don't assume big famous companies are immune
- look for red flags in code (document.write, eval, etc)
- does it slow everything down
- how are the companies treating you (for example, shady things like removing key people from emails)
- if it's a script, can you host it on your site? (otherwise it can change and break stuff)
- does it create global variables? (potentially interfere with your stuff although you should avoid that in a lot of cases)
- is it a huge thing for a small function?


how to know when you're good enough
- issues: people say things that make you feel like you're not good enough; info comes out that makes you think you don't know what's going on
- treatment: building things
- mindset shift: instead of worrying about knowing everything, be excited by what you've done and what there still is left to learn



how to stop solving the wrong problems
[different than this article: http://alistapart.com/article/whatstheproblem]
- organizational telephone (worst garbled version of idea gets transmitted)
- focus on the problem instead of a solution
- stop ignoring or not soliciting qualified opinions (often from people closest to a project)
- stop ignoring seemingly "unqualified" opinions
- keep in touch with actual users
- avoid a culture of fear (pressure to say what sounds good instead of the true assessment)
