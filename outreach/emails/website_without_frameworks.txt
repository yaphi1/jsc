[reader question] Is it possible to build a website without frameworks?


Yes.


To build a basic website, you need a few HTML tags and CSS styles. That's it.

If you want some interactive components, then you'll need some JavaScript.


So when would you use frameworks?

Frameworks, tools, etc. are there to help you when you need them. For example, if you're making a site that a non-developer will need to edit, I tend to like WordPress. It's also good for developers with blogs.

As an example, Simple Steps Code's main website doesn't use any frameworks, but the blog uses WordPress.


If you're making something with a lot of moving parts and reusable page elements (like a social media app or a video sharing site), something like React might be a good choice because it lets you replace something like this:

<div class="profile-card">
  <h2>Name: Waluigi</h2>
  <img src="waluigi.jpg">
  <div class="profile-info">
    <p>City: somewhere</p>
    <p>Hat color: purple</p>
  </div>
</div>

...with your own custom-made tags like this:

<Profile user="Waluigi" />

...which I think is pretty useful.

In terms of learning, before you use a framework you'll want to get comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Trust me. It'll make everything much easier for you.


Key takeaways:

- Yes, you can build a website without a framework, and it happens all the time. In many cases it's easier that way!

- Only use a framework when it makes a site easier to build or maintain.
