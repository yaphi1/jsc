Hi *|FNAME|*,

A reader asked me how to get unstuck when Google and Stackoverflow don't help.  This is one of the most important and challenging skills in coding, so I've decided to answer it for the group.

Here's what I personally do when I get stuck on a coding problem:

1. There are generally two types of code problems:
a) Technical errors (I missed a semicolon or something)
b) Unexpected behavior (the code is technically correct, but it doesn't do what I want).

First, I check if it's a technical error.  With JavaScript, for example, I would usually check my browser console to see if there were any notifications.

2. If the error is not technical, then I check the behavior of my code.  This is a little trickier, but here's my process:

- First break my code into as small pieces as possible and check if those pieces work.  Then gradually put them together again.

If that doesn't work, here's what I try next:

- Write in plain language what I want the code to do. (Example; If the user clicks, turn this box green and display a success message.)

- Break those instructions into even smaller steps when possible.

- Write code for each tiny step, and see if it works. (Example: Turn box green.  Did that work?  Detect if the user clicks.  Did that work?  Now turn the box green when the user clicks. Did that work? Etc.)  If something didn't work, either examine it more closely or break it into even smaller pieces.  If the pieces get so small that they feel almost stupidly simple, that's a good sign.  If not, that's okay too.

- If all else fails, breaking things down into smaller pieces means you'll have an easier time finding help on Google too.  For instance, you can find a much clearer answer to something like "detect click in JavaScript" than "create a fully-functional live chat social application in JavaScript."

- Keep testing and putting together small pieces until your whole code is ready.

I hope this helps!

Best,
