Web dev interviews behind the scenes


Having interviewed a good number of web dev candidates, I've got some advice.

It's better to know the underlying languages than a framework.

I saw so many people struggle with common pieces of layout because they depended on Bootstrap for everything instead of getting comfortable with CSS.

The thing is, if you know CSS, then you automatically know how to use Bootstrap because Bootstrap is mostly a bunch of pre-written CSS (and some JS).

However, if you prioritize learning Bootstrap over plain CSS, then you'll get stuck every time you need to lay out a part of a page on your own.

Same thing happened with Angular vs plain JavaScript.

My advice:
Get comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript first. Everything will be much easier for you as a result.
