Someone submitted something that made me laugh at myself



Last week, I issued a challenge: Recreate Google's home page in a creative way.

My favorite submission had the title "4x the power of raw Google."

Immediately, I launched into a series of thoughts.  What could this be?  Does this use some intense algorithms or APIs?  Does it have huge performance optimizations Google has overlooked?

Then I clicked on it.

Clever. Very clever.

I had to laugh at myself because I had completely overthought everything, and yet here was a smart, straightforward way of reaching the goal.

I really like this solution because it's an important reminder to step back and ask about the real problem we're trying to solve instead of immediately jumping in and making things complicated.

Unnecessary complexity creates so many problems including website errors and maintenance nightmares.

Here's a trick to avoid unnecessary complexity:

Instead of jumping into solutions and techniques, try stepping back and take some time to define the problem itself.

This step gets skipped so often, and it's the source of a lot of problems.

Bringing this up can help you look good in interviews too because it shows you're really thinking instead of just randomly acting.

I hope this helps!
