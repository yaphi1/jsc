One secret that good developers share



There's a secret that really good developers have in common.

It's also something that people who seem to be good at everything share.

That secret is that they're willing to be bad at stuff.

That's it.

A lot of people give up when they're not immediately able to do something.

However, the ones who get really good aren't afraid to be really bad.  They embrace it, enjoy it, and learn from it.  That's how they get better.  Meanwhile, everyone else is sitting on the sidelines complaining about how they just don't have what it takes, never realizing that that's not even true.

Another danger that can happen is when you get good at things, you might enjoy that comfort too much and forget what it's like to be new at something.  That's when you stop learning.  Avoid that situation at all costs.

My advice?

Don't be afraid to be bad at something.  It's the only way you'll get better.
