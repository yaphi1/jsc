A fun little disaster with pasted code



I accidentally set a trap for a bunch of people.

One day, I thought I'd post a helpful piece of code on a social sharing widget site's forum.

In the description, I warned people to change part of the code from my username to theirs.

I should have known better than to include my username at all.

People just copied and pasted the whole thing onto their sites, and to this day, I still get their social sharing analytics.

I tried to contact everyone, but it was too late.  They had no contact info available, so I was stuck.


Two key takeaways from this experience:

1. When putting anything on the web, don't assume the user will behave exactly as you hope.

2. Before copying and pasting code, please try to make sure you know what it does.


I hope you enjoyed this!

Best,
