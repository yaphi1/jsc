Imagine this scenario.

You've prepared for an interview. You know your stuff, and you know you'd be a great fit for the position.

Then, out of sheer bad luck, they ask you the one tiny thing you don't know.

Now it feels like everything else you know doesn't matter. All the time you spent preparing, all the things you know, all the work you've done... It doesn't seem to matter because you're being judged on that one thing you missed.

Maybe it's a concept you use every day, but you never saw the technical term for it, so you sound like you don't know. Or maybe it's just something you never came across.

It happens! There's a lot to know, and everyone knows different things than everyone else.

So how do you protect yourself against this scenario?

You need to control the story about yourself.

That means you start the interview with a brief, crisp overview of what you've done (this can be personal projects if you don't have professional experience) and why it's relevant to the interviewer's company. Then you offer to walk them through your portfolio. That way, you can set the tone of the entire interview by going through a tour of your best highlights instead of hoping you get lucky with random questions.

Define yourself or other people will do it for you.

I hope this helps!
