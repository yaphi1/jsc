how to stop solving the wrong problems
[different than this article: http://alistapart.com/article/whatstheproblem]
- organizational telephone (worst garbled version of idea gets transmitted)
- focus on the problem instead of a solution
- stop ignoring or not soliciting qualified opinions (often from people closest to a project)
- stop ignoring seemingly "unqualified" opinions
- keep in touch with actual users
- avoid a culture of fear (pressure to say what sounds good instead of the true assessment)


framework intimidation (too many names; too much fear)


meanness to beginners (or being more encouraging to those with less experience)
maybe stop discouraging new coders
- forums [don't say s-overflow by name]
- "helpful" stuff that's overwhelming (you need to know 100 things before you can get started)
- "requirements" that aren't actually required (related: not well-thought out job descriptions that discourage good coders)
- what makes a real developer (or what makes a great developer) and it always seems to correlate with the author's skills
