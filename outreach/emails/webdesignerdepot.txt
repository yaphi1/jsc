Hi!  I'm a front-end web developer by the name of Yaphi, and I'd love to write some articles for WebdesignerDepot.

To prove my writing is credible, here's an article on Sitepoint:

...and a mention from Treehouse:

...and an appearance on Lifehacker:

Article ideas:

- When Web Developers Solve the Wrong Problems
	- Mismatched incentives (trying to impress the client or manager instead of the customer)
	- Chasing one particular solution instead of asking about the problem
	- Not enough information to make the right judgement calls
	- Ideas mutate as they go from person to person (so much that the original good idea might get lost)
	- Specific steps to make sure you're solving the right problems

- How to Know When You're "Good Enough" at Web Development
	- Navigate common traps that make you feel inadequate (certain comments from others, floods of information, etc)
	- Specific action steps to improve without wasting time
	- Mindset shift that will help you learn faster and enjoy it more

- What Stops People from Learning JavaScript
	- Why rushing makes you go slower
	- Spending hours piecing together random answers when it would take minutes to understand the underlying concepts instead
	- Taking the wrong psychological approach (easily fixed)
	- Not practicing a concept after learning it (and the compounding effects of this)
	- Too high of a reading-to-coding ratio

My desired rate is $150 per article.

Let me know if any of these sound like good topics.  I'd be more than happy to tweak the ideas as well.

Best,

Yaphi
