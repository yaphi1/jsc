(in no particular order)



- how to avoid the marketing tactical vortex
	- examples of focusing on everything and getting no results
	- one startup incubator - bad sign: when they have a logo and buzzwords but no real prototype
	- latching onto shiny technology as a substitute for thinking

- making responsive a pain
	- too many media queries
	- overly complex media queries (unnecessary portrait vs landscape instead of just width for example) (won't see when resizing browser)
	- lack of fluidity
	- stacking relative sizes on top of each other
	- needless query sandwiches and gaps instead of progressive enhancement

- simple naming trick for clearer code: when naming, do you have to explain the name?

- putting something off? don't blame yourself. that trains your mind to come up with excuses to deflect the blame.  when you try to do something, your mind automatically jumps to reasons you can't do it

- advice to friends about portfolio; over a year later, they hadn't started
(most of the time it takes to do something is the time spent not doing it)
(action step: do something this week)
(by signing up for list, readers have already proven that they take steps to learn)

- learning canvas: use glow pong example of learning in one weekend and how most of the time it took was the time spent not doing it

- UI anti-pattern: follow that scrolling thingy down the page

- space jam "special stuff" was just water all along; everyone is looking for a magic shortcut (use example of workout question), but the biggest shortcut is to actually get started

- putting off the things that matter most to you in favor of small daily distractions (harness the power of distractions to do something you actually want to 
do)

- "this is worth untangling your headphones for" That was exactly the unconscious barrier stopping me from watching a video, and by addressing it, it immediately made me watch it.

- importance of preparation (everyone focuses on the championship or the big moment but it was already won or lost in the preparation)

- preparation is like a superpower (since it gives you so much more time, it's like everything is in slow motion)

- don't let technique get in the way (get comfortable with the technical fundamentals, so that's not getting in the way of coding your ideas)

- why the best ones are not advertised

- "not a code person" (maybe use this in next sales funnel)

- the copy-paste approach: seems like a shortcut; actually wastes hours/days, so it's better to learn underlying js (use in sales)

- tutorials can be misleading about the path of process [sent]

- how to get hired at facebook according to people at facebook

- things that stop people learning web development (examples: framework intimidation, worrying about what's next instead of doing what's now, doing too much at a time, following tutorials and not practicing on your own, being so concerned about doing everything that they don't do anything)

- thing great developers have in common (or really people who get good at anything): the people who are great at things are the ones who are okay with being bad at things (they don't immediately freeze up or shut down; they're okay with being bad and getting better)

- css specificity wars

- perils of third-party code (maybe use as part of sales launch)

- stack-overflow-driven development and the copy-pasters (could use as part of launch)
