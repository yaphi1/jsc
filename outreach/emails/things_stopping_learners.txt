things stopping learners

[for webdesignerdepot]





fear of too many frameworks and tools
- multi part fear: what direction to take, what if I don't know enough, what if I spend time on one thing and it becomes obsolete

worrying about what's next instead of doing what's now

doing too much at a time

following tutorials and not practicing on your own

being so concerned about doing everything that they don't do anything)

starting and stopping

trying to piece together stuff

getting forum answers instead of learning underlying concepts


















notes
