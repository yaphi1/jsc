The worst web dev job description I've ever been tricked by



I remember the worst web dev job description I've ever been tricked by.

It sounded like a legit development position.  I thought I'd be coding neat things.  I went through their application, their screening, and their interviewing.

Then I got in.

Guess what. The job turned out to be mostly copying and pasting text content into a template.

There are two main points to this story:

1. It's really easy for job descriptions to make you feel like you're not good enough when you're actually way overqualified.

2. Whether you're in an interview or you're talking to your companies of choice beforehand, you really need to grill them for specifics of what you'll be doing.








Notes:

- sounded like legit dev thing

- actually copy and paste text into a template

- all that vetting for this
