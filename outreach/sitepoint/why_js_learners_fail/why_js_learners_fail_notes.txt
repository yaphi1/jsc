Why People Fail to Learn JavaScript (and What to Do About It)



Outline


intro
- motivation for article (people give up on js when they don't need to)
- this can also be applied to learning other things


overanalyzing instead of getting started
- reading about all the frameworks
- just get better at js and you'll be better at all of them, then find out which frameworks are relevant to the places you're looking at

learning a framework before learning plain js
- memorizing magic words instead of understanding what they do
- like it's much easier to read a book when you know how words and sentences work
- get overwhelmed trying to keep up with frameworks instead of understanding how they all work at once

moving to the next step too soon
- easy to move on after understanding something, but that's the time to stay with it instead

not breaking concepts down into small enough pieces
- too tempting to try to understand something as a whole

attempting a complex project too early
- make a quick social network

not practicing under real-life conditions
- only coding within a website (or after copying a file) rather than trying something from scratch on your own
- the best way to prepare to have the training wheels off is to practice with the training wheels off

comparing oneself to more advanced people
- see one's own bloopers and other people's highlights
- people have seen my tutorials and asked how I wrote such clean code; the whole process was actually a mess and they're just seeing the polished version

consuming information and not actually coding
- watching videos, reading tutorials, etc; feel like you're learning, but you're not; need to actually write code

following tutorials without understanding or experimenting
- linearly following steps; doesn't teach practice of solving a problem which is much more experimental and incremental
- instead, experiment with each step; example: for slideshow, experiment with responding to a click, then animation, then whatever else

conclusion
- all points lead people to give up, which is the biggest mistake of all
- if it's difficult sometimes, that's good; it means you're learning new things; if it's always too easy, that might be bad since you're not stretching your abilities
