intro:

what this is for and what this is not:

	- getting info from query string; getting part of url after question mark, but not including hash part (link to definition of query string and explanation of url parameters)

	- example of why one would get url parameters

	- nothing built in jQuery, so you'd have to either use plain JS or a plugin or library



quick pure js solution (along with usage examples)

how it works
	- what is a valid query string
	- line by line of code
	- how it handles special cases

- edge cases
	- duplicate query keys: there's no spec on this (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1746507/authoritative-position-of-duplicate-http-get-query-keys)
	- semicolons? do those get used
	- &amp; does that get used?
	- multiple &s in a row
	- multiple question marks?
	- no equals sign
	- key and equals sign only
	- non-standard characters
	- badly formed urls (then that's the url's problem)


version that gets all params and spits out an object

existing libraries and solutions; benefits and drawbacks
	- tradeoff: extra code, but extra functionality
	- maybe mention libraries, and briefly what they do for url parsing, but then say it's beyond the scope of this article
