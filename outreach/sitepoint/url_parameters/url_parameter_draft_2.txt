intro:

what this is for and what this is not:

	- getting info from query string; getting part of url after question mark, but not including hash part (link to definition of query string and explanation of url parameters)

	- example of why one would get url parameters

	- nothing built in jQuery, so you'd have to either use plain JS or a plugin or library



quick pure js solution (along with usage examples)

how it works
	- what is a valid query string
	- line by line of code
	- how it handles special cases

- edge cases
	- duplicate query keys: there's no spec on this (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1746507/authoritative-position-of-duplicate-http-get-query-keys)
	- semicolons? do those get used
	- &amp; does that get used?
	- multiple &s in a row
	- multiple question marks?
	- no equals sign
	- key and equals sign only
	- non-standard characters
	- badly formed urls (then that's the url's problem)


version that gets all params and spits out an object

existing libraries and solutions; benefits and drawbacks
	- tradeoff: extra code, but extra functionality
	- maybe mention libraries, and briefly what they do for url parsing, but then say it's beyond the scope of this article








example weird urls from demopixels.js:

doubleclick semicolons:
	'http://4476300.fls.doubleclick.net/activityi;src=4476300;type=gener0;cat=Demo_0;u5=demo;ord=' + doubleclick_floodlight_random + '?'

	- don't double-decode! (if one of the encoded characters is a percent, and you decode it twice, you risk messing up your url)


semicolons not widely followed, but recommended by w3c:

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt
	3.4. Query
	The query component contains non-hierarchical data that, along with
	data in the path component (Section 3.3), serves to identify a
	resource within the scope of the URI's scheme and naming authority
	(if any).  The query component is indicated by the first question
	mark ("?") character and terminated by a number sign ("#") character
	or by the end of the URI.
