tutorials misleading

what happens and why this is important

- why and how it happens
- story
- problems and consequences
- real code vs tutorial code


solutions:

real style of coding:

small pieces, lots of testing and trying

(each of the following will have examples and benefits)
- make small test cases for each step
- if there's a concept you're not sure about, don't just skip over it (this is some of the most important learning)
- adapt concepts to other mini projects
- redo the project without the tutorial
- create a version with a twist
