- the common phrase that often spells doom
	- I'll make a quick slideshow/quiz/etc

- too much too soon
	- complexity, lots of stuff

Intro
	- first be clear that projects are often a great way to learn
	- say there are times when projects can be disastrous (and create reader curiosity as to why)

Two most common traps with projects and how they make people give up
	- trap 1: easy-sounding project; immediate failure
	- trap 2: false success; complete project but can't remember any of it

Why the traps happen and what effect they have
	- too much too soon
	- psychological spiral (if I can't do this easy-sounding project, maybe I'm not cut out for JavaScript)

Specific examples of projects that hinder learning

What to do instead (with specific examples)
	- also includes how and when to incorporate projects

Key takeaways
