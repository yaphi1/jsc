## Set up the structure

We want to create a situation where we can list our quiz's questions and answers, and our JavaScript will automatically generate a quiz.

That way, we won't need to write a bunch of repetitive markup, and we can add and remove questions easily.

To set up the structure of our JavaScript quiz, we'll need to start with the following HTML:

- A div to store the quiz
- A button to submit the quiz
- A div to store the results

Here's how that would look:

```html
&lt;div id="quiz"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;button id="submit"&gt;Get Results&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;div id="results"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
```
