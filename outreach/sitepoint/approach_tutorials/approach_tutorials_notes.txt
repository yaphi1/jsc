How to Get the Most Out of Tutorials



outline:


Intro: It's too easy to go through a JS tutorial and not get the most out of it.
	- Brief discussion of frustrations of going through a tutorial but not being able to apply it afterwards
	- Introduce process to get the most out of tutorials (in terms of understanding, remembering, etc)

Step 1: Before starting, get a few concepts in tool belt (variables, functions, arrays, etc)

Step 2: Make small test cases for each step (use slideshow example)

Step 3: If there's a concept you're not sure about (e.g.: arrays), don't just skip over it (this is some of the most important learning)

Step 4: Adapt concepts to other mini projects (get better at underlying concepts; example guest list with arrays)

Step 5: Redo the project without the tutorial
	- If too difficult, this will reveal areas that require more practice
	- After successful completion, add a twist

Conclusion
- Don't just go linear. Dig in and make sure you understand. It will seem longer, but you'll cover a lot at once, and you'll remember it better.
- Better to go slowly once and understand a ton of stuff than to go quickly, forget it all, and watch your time evaporate.

How to Get the Most Out of Tutorials



- before starting, get a few concepts in tool belt (variables, functions, arrays, etc)

(each of the following will have examples and benefits)
- make small test cases for each step (clock example: first show current date then hours etc.)

- if there's a concept you're not sure about (e.g.: arrays), don't just skip over it (this is some of the most important learning)

- adapt concepts to other mini projects (get better at underlying concepts; example guest list with arrays)

- redo the project without the tutorial

- create a version with a twist
