titles:
- interview hacks for when you don't know the answers
- how to sound good in interviews even if you don't know the answers




say how you'd find out things you don't know

google (say which terms)
stack overflow
cross-verify with mdn
test in console


example of something you didn't know and how you learned it


make it collaborative


make it a two-way interview (you're trying to find out about them too)
- shows competence
- makes you look discerning instead of desperate


questions:
- not about what you get but about how they work (not what's the salary but instead)


when you don't know
- start with things you do know
- break down problem into smaller parts
- narrow it down and get specific about the parts you don't know
- once you're specific:
	- don't be afraid to ask for info or clarification
	- ask if there's anything else you might be overlooking
	- talk about how you might find that info
	- after you've gotten as far as you can, say you're always interested to learn and ask how they might approach it



mention input validation



prepare an opening story about yourself and your projects
- this can let you dictate how you're perceived instead of just going in as an unknown and answering questions (it's the difference between a professional introducing themselves vs a student nervously showing up for a test)



talk about something you're excited about
