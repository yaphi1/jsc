For some reason Javascript tutorials often start with "In this tutorial we will write a simple ..." and, 12,000 lines later you can't remember what it was you were trying to learn.

Possible headlines:
- When that "simple" JavaScript tutorial is super complicated
- Why JavaScript tutorials can suck for learning



points to cover:

start with the problem; paint a picture of it

why the problem happens
- tutorials are created one small piece at a time but then dumped in one big article

give practical advice for how to use tutorials
- start with minimum unit
- experiment
- try next step on your own first in cases where you think you might be able to (or even if you're not quite sure)
- if there's a way to try out a later concept in a small unit, try that first (instead of piling the animation onto your slideshow project, try the animation by itself first)
