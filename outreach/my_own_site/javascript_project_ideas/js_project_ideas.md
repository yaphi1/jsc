*This [article](https://simplestepscode.com/javascript-project-ideas/) originally appeared on [Simple Steps Code](https://simplestepscode.com/) which tries its best to help people [learn JavaScript and actually remember it](https://simplestepscode.com/learn-javascript/).*

Over and over, I hear people want JavaScript project ideas.

I've decided to start an ongoing list, and I'd love for you to jump in and share project ideas. The ideas don't need to be inhumanly creative or anything like that. If possible, I'd prefer plain JS, but don't restrict yourself if some framework or tool is required.

Also, before you attempt JavaScript projects, [read this article](https://simplestepscode.com/dangers-of-projects/) to make sure you don't fall into the trap of attempting something too huge too soon and giving up.

Here's the list of JavaScript projects so far:

## UI stuff
- Autocorrecting text box
- Form validator
- Collapsible navigation menu
- Countdown clock
- Modal dialog box
- A site that lets people design their own UI elements (buttons, mastheads, etc.)
- Customize greeting if people came from a certain site

## E-commerce
- Price estimator
- Front end of an interactive online store
- Shopping cart front end

## Finance
- Tip calculator
- Cost splitter
- Investment calculator
- House or car payment calculator
- Savings calculator

## Tools and utilities
- Page that grabs data from somewhere on the web and puts it in a useful format
- Random name picker
- Unit conversion calculator
- Secret message encoder/decoder

## Fun and games
- Basic quiz
- Rock-paper-scissors game
- Pong game
- Madlibs
- A mario-style game
- A zelda-style game (more likely a 2d one until 3d performance improves on the web)

## Social applications
- Social network front end
- Real time chat app (using socket io)

## API stuff
- Gif search, video search, etc
- Something with maps (like a store locator)
- Something with geolocation (e.g.: find XYZ near you)
- Real-time feed of tweets about a subject of your choice
- Text-to-speech
- Combinations of any of the above

## Console tricks
- Scrape a page through your console and get info easily without having to copy, paste, and format each thing by hand (great for research)
- Change colors of your favorite sites to see what they'd look like


I hope you've enjoyed this, and feel free to let me know if you have other suggestions.
