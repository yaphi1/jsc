JavaScript project ideas and practical uses


I'm going to keep an ongoing list of practical JavaScript project ideas since this was a highly requested topic.

If there's anything you want to see added to this list, feel free to reply directly to this email. (All responses go directly to my personal inbox, so I will read your message.)

Here's the list so far:

UI stuff
	Autocorrecting text box
	Form validator
	Collapsible navigation menu
	Countdown clock
	Modal dialog box
	A site that lets people design their own UI elements (buttons, mastheads, etc.)
	Customize greeting if people came from a certain site

E-commerce
	Price estimator
	Front end of an interactive online store
	Shopping cart front end

Finance
	Tip calculator
	Cost splitter
	Investment calculator
	House or car payment calculator
	Savings calculator

Tools and utilities
	Page that grabs data from somewhere on the web and puts it in a useful format
	Random name picker
	Unit conversion calculator
	Secret message encoder/decoder

Fun and games
	Basic quiz
	Rock-paper-scissors game
	Pong game
	Madlibs
	A mario-style game
	A zelda-style game (more likely a 2d one until 3d performance improves on the web)

Social applications
	Social network front end
	Real time chat app (using socket io)

API stuff
	Gif search, video search, etc
	Something with maps (like a store locator)
	Something with geolocation (e.g.: find XYZ near you)
	Real-time feed of tweets about a subject of your choice
	Text-to-speech
	Combinations of any of the above

Console tricks
	Scrape a page through your console and get info easily without having to copy, paste, and format each thing by hand (great for research)
	Change colors of your favorite sites to see what they'd look like


I hope you've enjoyed this, and feel free to let me know if you have other suggestions.
