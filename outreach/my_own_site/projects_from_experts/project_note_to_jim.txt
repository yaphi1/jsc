Hey Jim,

I hope all's well!

I'm planning to make a post on my site featuring a collection of front-end portfolio project ideas from the experts.

I figured I'd reach out to you to see if you'd be willing to suggest one project idea for people who are learning front-end web development (more would be even better, but I'd still be thrilled with one).

Since I'd like this to take as little of your time as possible, here are some fill-in-the-blanks answers you can use if you'd like:

- Hand-code [something] in SVG.
- Re-create [cool CodePen demo]
- Build a [common UI component]
- Look at [website] for inspiration

So far, I've reached out to Chris Coyier, who replied essentially that learners can practice by copying websites they like.  That's the only taken idea, so anything else is fair game.

Ideally this will be beneficial for the community (a very popular question is being answered) and for the contributors (cross-pollination of audiences).

I plan to tie in a link to whatever you'd like, so let me know if this sounds good!

Best,

Yaphi
