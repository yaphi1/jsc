I'm planning to make a blog post featuring a collection of front-end portfolio project ideas from the experts.

I figured I'd reach out to you to see if you'd be willing to suggest one project idea for people who are learning front-end web development (more would be even better, but I'd still be thrilled with one).

The format would be a sentence, a couple of sentences, or a few bullet points, depending on what's convenient for you.

Since I'd like this to take as little of your time as possible, here are some fill-in-the-blanks answers you can use if you're up for this:

- Hand-code [something fun] in SVG.
- Re-create [cool CodePen demo]
- Build a [common UI component]
- Look at [website] for inspiration
- Create experiment based on [concept]

These are summaries of the responses I've received so far:

Chris Coyier (CSS-Tricks and CodePen):
- Closely copy websites you like

Jim Hibbard (JavaScript editor at Sitepoint):
- Reimplement a library (such as lightbox or jQuery)

Ben Moss (Editor at WebdesignerDepot)
- Find out why a language or tool is useful by doing a task without it

Sara Soueidan (Dev of the Year and writer at Codrops):
- Don't wait to start, share what you learn, and break down other people's code

Parker Phinney (Interview Cake)
- Write a JS bookmarklet that manipulates other websites in an interesting and helpful way

Other than these, all topics are open.

Ideally this will be beneficial for the community (a very popular question is being answered) and for the contributors (cross-pollination of audiences).

I plan to tie in a link to whatever you'd like, so let me know if this sounds good!

Best,

Yaphi
