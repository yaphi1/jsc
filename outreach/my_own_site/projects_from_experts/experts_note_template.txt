I'm planning to make a post on my site featuring a collection of front-end portfolio project ideas from the experts.

I figured I'd reach out to you to see if you'd be willing to suggest one project idea for people who are learning front-end web development (more would be even better, but I'd still be thrilled with one).

These are mini-summaries of the responses I've recieved so far:

Chris Coyier (CSS-Tricks and CodePen):
- Closely copy websites you like

Jim Hibbard (JavaScript editor at Sitepoint):
- Reimplement a library (such as lightbox or jQuery)

Other than these, all topics are open.

Since I'd like this to take as little of your time as possible, here are some fill-in-the-blanks answers you can use if you'd like:

- Hand-code [something] in SVG.
- Re-create [cool CodePen demo]
- Build a [common UI component]
- Look at [website] for inspiration

Ideally this will be beneficial for the community (a very popular question is being answered) and for the contributors (cross-pollination of audiences).

I plan to tie in a link to whatever you'd like, so let me know if this sounds good!

Best,

Yaphi
