	Repost from RBT: [How to get Publicity from Business Insider-- even though you're still not an expert (Script included)]
	- at selena soo's event
	- explained to ztl person how to get pitch accepted
	- likes to cover success stories of inspiring entrepreneurs

note: search for ztl members on site and see what type of coverage they're getting
checked so far: danny margulies, selena soo

patterns of posts from ztl members
	- common one is that they made $X in [amount of time] from doing [activity]
	- another pattern is business mistakes to avoid from someone in the know
