Labeling yourself

People give themselves destructive labels all the time. They'll say things like "I'm not one of those tech whiz kids," or "I was never a code person."

The thing is, no one is born with tech abilities. These are learned skills, and they're not restricted to a special group of people.

When you label yourself as someone who can't do things, you sabotage yourself for no reason.

So should you "just believe in yourself" and everything will fall into place?

No.

Instead of worrying whether you're good enough, take the smallest possible first step to learn. Then repeat.

If you keep taking small steps to learn, your doubts will slowly become irrelevant because you'll have concrete progress under your belt.

Soon, you'll be the "tech person" others tell themselves they can never be.






Chasing every trend

[mention front-end road map]







Moving slower by rushing











notes:



X mistakes that can kill your (web development | tech | coding) career before it starts



- labeling yourself
having a fixed mindset

- moving slower by rushing

- chasing every trend instead of focusing (listening to the internet)

- not building a portfolio

- worrying about the best way to learn instead of picking a way and going with it

- believing the job descriptions

- convincing yourself you don't have enough time

- taking on huge pieces

- being good at everything you do
(a sign of not trying new things)
