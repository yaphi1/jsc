I saw your Accelerator post about how to get featured in Business Insider, and I thought it was fantastic. The process and the level of detail made me feel like it was realistic and achievable to get featured there, and 

notes:

- saw post in Accel and articles in b-ins
- contact: Libby Kane
- made it seem doable to get in b-ins
- having been on both sides of interview table, people need to stop labeling themselves in destructive ways
- angle: interview mistakes
- credibility: writing has appeared in various places [list]
- key question: am I on the right track with this type of angle?


possible angles:
- story about interviewing a super prepared candidate
-
