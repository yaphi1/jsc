So I noticed something interesting about coding tutorials

I was trying to find a JavaScript quiz tutorial, and while I admired the ones I saw, certain issues kept coming up.

- **Too much extra stuff.** Many of the tutorials ended up incorporating too many concepts at a time. For some people, this would be great, but I just wanted the bare bones of how to make a quiz in plain JavaScript. I didn't want all the animations, styles, code libraries, etc. to distract me.

- **Bad habits.** Some of the tutorials included a lot of repetition that could have been a loop instead. That would have required lots of manual changes to maintain. I wanted something flexible and maintainable.

- **Unclear about where to put stuff.** Sometimes the tutorials would show random snippets of code without having a clear demo showing where everything goes.

I tried my hand at creating a [JavaScript quiz tutorial](https://simplestepscode.com/javascript-quiz-tutorial/) that would be simple while not requiring any outside code libraries.

Liked it? Hated it? Have questions? Let me know!
