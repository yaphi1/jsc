dissection of what's happening in the code of tracking tags and some of the scary side effects
(mention lots of trust given when third party script is used)



exposing credit card info


overwrite your variables
- particularly bad example: using two variables to create one random number


bogging down scrolling


close ties to dom: setting you up for errors if you ever change your layout


creating unnecessary risks by using eval


preventing async and blocking your page (document.write)


changing your layout (adding gaps to bottom or top of page)
- comcast/xfinity bottom gap


bringing in other scripts


font signature thingy (and maybe canvas fingerprinting)


slow-loading pages
- use examples of BI and FC with lots of time loading those scripts
