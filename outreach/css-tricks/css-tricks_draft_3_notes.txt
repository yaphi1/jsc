"We study the ability of a passive eavesdropper to leverage “third-party” HTTP tracking cookies for mass surveillance. If two web pages embed the same tracker which tags the browser with a unique cookie, then the adversary can link visits to those pages from the same user (i.e., browser instance) even if the user’s IP address varies. Further, many popular websites leak a logged-in user’s identity to an eavesdropper in unencrypted traffic."

"the adversary can reconstruct 62—73% of a typical user’s browsing history"

"Finally, we find that some browser-based privacy tools mitigate the attack while others are largely ineffective."
