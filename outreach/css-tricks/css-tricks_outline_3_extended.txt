Title: Things To Know (and The Potential Dangers of) Third-Party Scripts

- QUICK intro
  - What is a third-party script
    - <script> JavaScript
  - Reasons why sites put third-party scripts on their sites
    - ads, analytics, retargeting, etc.

- A third-party script might be a privacy concern
  - They can report back data that you weren't aware of
  - Embarrassing?
  - Data/example
    - fb: behavior, sites visited, demographics, ip address, purchase history, location, etc
  - Talk about "tracking", but careful to be specific. 
    - Retargeting is tracking, but it's kinda "known" tracking. Weird/creepy sometimes, but not the mysterious secret kind most people talk about.
      - device fingerprinting
        - canvas fingerprinting, font fingerprinting, browser fingerprinting, etc

    - There may be tracking going on we don't even know about. Evidence? Concerns?
      - eavesdroppers (42% of sites present unique identifiers in plain text): preferences, history, purchases, address, full name, email, location, etc
      - the adversary can reconstruct 62—73% of a typical user’s browsing history
      - NSA piggybacked on Google's scripts to track people
      - Some third-party vendors ask for email addresses to be sent and I've had to refuse due to PII concerns
      - some trackers bring in their own third-party trackers unexpectedly
      - security holes can lead to extra unexpected effects (like credit cards being taken)

  - Data/example
  - https
  - subresource integreity

- A third-party script might be a performance concern
