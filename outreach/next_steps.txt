[ZTL M4 - Question about next steps]
For some reason, I'm blanking on what to do next. I have a bunch of things on my to-do list, but I'm sitting here with analysis paralysis, so I figured it would be better to talk it out rather than keep thinking in circles.
.
First a quick data snapshot:
Current list size (Apr 21 2017): 4,700
Number of launches so far: 3
List size at last launch (Dec 2016): 3,200
Total ZTL product revenue so far: $5,400
.
Posible to-dos:
.
- Write new guest post for a site where I regularly contribute
.
- Update domain name of membership site to be more general (so I can add multiple products in the future); lots of reconfiguration work required
.
- Maybe get a better email automation service. (With Mailchimp, I find myself having to do a lot of things manually that should be automatic. Also, they've had a site error that has stopped people from seeing monthly growth for the entirety of 2017 so far.)
.
- Automate sales process and sell earlier.
.
- Find out how to get on bigger sites (specifically Lifehacker and Business Insider). This is the only to-do I'm excited about, but it's the one I feel least knowledgeable about.

			- titles:
			The Phrase that Holds Back Your Tech Career

				- what to do about it
					- every time you start thinking you're not a ___ person, reframe as you haven't practiced yet
					- instead of giving up before starting, take the first step
					- get comfortable being a beginner (treat it like a new game or a new episode or a new meal or whatever it is) (it's really exciting because there's so much progress you can make and the feeling of accomplishment multiplies)
					- pick small milestones and you'll go farther

- look into creating more intermediate material





[Question about conversion rates]

For my second launch, I launched to my full list (raising the price from $49 to $99).

How should I measure the conversion rate without getting skewed results from people who have already been launched to before?

Do I measure from the new people only?  Should I just measure out of the total anyway?  Should I include the customers from the previous launch in my calculations?

The point of this is to figure out whether the price is where it needs to be.

Putting this question here because others might benefit from it as well.

Stats:

Launch 2
Total subscribers: 2000
New subscribers since previous launch: 800
Price: $99
Paying customers (after refunds): 15
Conversion rate: 0.75% of total list
Conversion rate: 1.875% of new subs


Launch 1
Total subscribers: 1300
Price: $49
Paying customers (after refunds): 22
Conversion rate: 1.7%
