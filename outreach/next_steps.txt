- look into creating more intermediate material





[Question about conversion rates]

For my second launch, I launched to my full list (raising the price from $49 to $99).

How should I measure the conversion rate without getting skewed results from people who have already been launched to before?

Do I measure from the new people only?  Should I just measure out of the total anyway?  Should I include the customers from the previous launch in my calculations?

The point of this is to figure out whether the price is where it needs to be.

Putting this question here because others might benefit from it as well.

Stats:

Launch 2
Total subscribers: 2000
New subscribers since previous launch: 800
Price: $99
Paying customers (after refunds): 15
Conversion rate: 0.75% of total list
Conversion rate: 1.875% of new subs


Launch 1
Total subscribers: 1300
Price: $49
Paying customers (after refunds): 22
Conversion rate: 1.7%







notes:


- research lifehacker



- why people struggle to learn js
- tutorials can be misleading (how to approach projects article)

- make quiz code (and outline process)
- hacks to become a better coder
	- don't be afraid to look stupid asking questions
	- don't do your thinking and coding at the same time


- interview hacks article
- js closures reddit post



- quiz article (sitepoint)
- maybe quick tip "for loop" article (sitepoint)

- gravity article: drop, jump, bounce, arrow (css-tricks)



- add intermediate content to course


list growth strategies:
- more seo articles for sitepoint
- aim get bigger partnerships (lifehacker)


sales growth strategies:
- interview recruiters and hiring managers about what they're looking for, what they wish candidates would do, etc, then put in course
- add intermediate level




sales email ideas:

- tale of three learning paths: videos vs codecademy vs ss (videos were fun but too passive, codecademy showed progress but couldn't apply in real life, ss did it and actually understood it, etc)




upcoming:

update course
