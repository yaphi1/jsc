		<h1>The Event Object - Gain More Control Over Your Events</h1>


		<p>By now you know how to detect events such as clicks, key presses, and more.</p>

		<p>But what if you're not satisfied yet?</p>

		<p>What if you want to know where on the page someone clicked, which key they pressed, or where they moved their mouse?</p>

		<p>Good news! There's something called the <strong>event object</strong> that gives you all this info.</p>



		<div class="special_section getting_started">
			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p>
				Copy and paste the following code into a new HTML document:
			</p>
			<pre><code class="language-markup">
				&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
				&lt;html&gt;
				&lt;head&gt;
					&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
					&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
				&lt;/head&gt;
				&lt;body&gt;


				&lt;script&gt;

				&lt;/script&gt;
				&lt;/body&gt;
				&lt;/html&gt;
			</code></pre>

			<p>
				For convenience, you can start with this HTML document to type the code from the lesson.
			</p>
			<p><b>Remember to put all scripts between the script tags.</b></p>
		</div>





		<div class="section">
			<h2>What is the event object and how do you find it?</h2>

			<p>Whenever an event happens (like a click or a key press), JavaScript gives you an object with information about that event.</p>

			<p>This is called the <b>event object</b>.</p>

			<p>Type the following script to see how it works:</p>

			<pre><code>
				window.onclick = function(e){
					console.log(e);
				};
			</code></pre>

			<p>Now click anywhere in the browser window and watch the console.</p>

			<p>Notice that each time you click, you get a bunch of data about that click.  That data is the <b>event object</b>.  You can call it whatever you want, but we've just called it "e" because it's short.</p>

			<p>Quick Note:<br> For simplicity, we're checking when the user clicks anywhere on the window, but this could easily be any other event like a button click, a key press inside a text box, or other things.</p>

		</div>





		<div class="section">
			<h2>Get the coordinates of a click</h2>

			<p>Remember that with objects, you can access their properties.  The event object is no different.</p>

			<p>Type the following to get the coordinates of each click:</p>

			<pre><code>
				window.onclick = function(e){
					console.log('x = ' + e.pageX);
					console.log('y = ' + e.pageY);
				};
			</code></pre>

			<p>Neat, right?</p>

			<p>There are plenty of ways you can use this.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Maybe you have a map and you want to place a marker where the user clicks.</li>
				<li>Maybe you're creating web analytics software and you want to record where users click most.</li>
				<li>Maybe you're making a game whose input involves clicking.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Also, feel free to play around with various events and event object properties.</p>

		</div>






		<div class="section">
			<h2>Find out which key was pressed</h2>

			<p>Type the following to get data about each key press:</p>

			<pre><code>
				window.onkeydown = function(e){
					console.log(e);
					console.log(e.keyCode);
				};
			</code></pre>

			<p>Here we're looking at two things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The event object (all data about this key press)</li>
				<li>The pressed key's code number ("a" gives 65, "d" gives 68, and the up arrow gives 38 for example)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>When you see the event object in your console, you can click on it to see what properties are available.</p>

			<p><strong>Note about keyCode:</strong><br> There have been a lot of changes in how key presses are handled, so when you're making your big site or app, be sure to check compatibility.</p>

			<h2>What is a prototype and what does it do?</h2>

			<p>In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties from other objects.</p>

			<p>A <b>prototype</b> is a hidden object that sits in the background and allows other objects to inherit its properties.</p>

			<p>All JavaScript objects have a <b>prototype</b>.</p>

			<p>It's okay if this sounds a bit confusing.</p>

			<p>Try this example to clear things up:</p>

			<pre><code>
				// your basic car constructor function
				function Car(color, speed){
					this.color = color;
					this.topSpeed = speed;
				}

				// add the showCarInfo function to Car's prototype object
				// this means all the cars will get access to showCarInfo
				Car.prototype.showCarInfo = function(){
					console.log('Color: ' + this.color);
					console.log('Top Speed: '+ this.topSpeed);
				};

				// create a bunch of cars
				var myCar = new Car('red', 200);
				var yourCar = new Car('blue', 150);
				var otherCar = new Car('green', 180);
				var yetAnotherCar = new Car('gold', 240);

				// show your car (notice showCarInfo isn't there)
				console.log('yourCar:');
				console.log(yourCar);

				// try using showCarInfo anyway
				console.log('here is the car info:');
				yourCar.showCarInfo();
			</code></pre>

			<p>What?</p>

			<p><code>showCarInfo()</code> wasn't in the <code>yourCar</code> object, so how were we able to use it?</p>

			<p>Here's how:</p>

			<p>We changed the Car's <b>prototype</b> object so that all the cars would automatically get access to <code>showCarInfo</code>.</p>

			<p><strong>Editing Car's prototype has these advantages:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Convenient updates</strong>
					<br>You can update the prototype any time and all the cars will get the updates.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Less clutter</strong>
					<br>All of the cars are referencing one prototype object, so the same showCarInfo function isn't cluttering every single car object.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Saves space</strong>
					<br>It's better for memory when you're storing a function in one prototype object instead of putting it in every single car object.
				</li>
			</ul>

			
			<div class="special_section terminology">
				<h3>The prototype chain</h3>
				<p>When you call an object's property (a car's color for example), first your browser will check if that property is inside the object.</p>
				<p>If it doesn't find the property there in the object, then it'll check the prototype.</p>

				<p>Then it checks the prototype's prototype.  It keeps going until it finds nothing left.</p>

				<p>For example, you might have three kinds of object: Animal, Dog, and Poodle.  Poodle inherits properties from Dog, which inherits properties from Animal.</p>

				<p>This series of objects in which one inherits from the next is called the <b>prototype chain</b>.</p>
				
				<p>For the sake of maintainability, you don't want to go too many levels deep.</p>

				<p>Also, there's no need to worry a whole lot about the prototype chain at the moment.  I just want you to see the term at least once.</p>

			<h2>Exercises:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Social network profiles - Part 1</strong></p>
					<p>Create a constructor function called <code>User</code>.</p>
					<p>Each new User object should have the following properties: <code>name</code>, <code>city</code>, and <code>hobby</code>.</p>
					<p>Use your constructor function to create at least three new users.</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p><strong>Social network profiles - Part 2</strong></p>
					<p>Start with your code from the previous question.</p>
					<p>Update User's prototype so that all the user objects can access a method called <code>showProfile</code>. (Remember a method is just a function that belongs to an object.</p>
					<p>The function should show a given user's profile neatly in a div.</p>
				</li>
