		<h1>How to get the most out of this course</h1>

		<div>
			<h2>First off, remember why you're excited to learn JavaScript</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Freedom to create what you want</li>
				<li>Much higher salaries</li>
				<li>More job options</li>
				<li>Having more fun with your awesome new skills</li>
			</ul>

			<p>These are some of the things you can look forward to when you learn JavaScript.</p>

			<p>A lot of people never invest in themselves like this, so by making the decision to learn, you're already way ahead of the people who do nothing and wait for life to happen to them.</p>

			<p>Congrats!</p>

		</div>


		<div class="section special_section before_you_begin">
			<h2>Before you begin</h2>

			<p>You should have some familiarity with <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>.</p>
			
			<p>If you can do the following things, you know enough:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>HTML:</strong><br>You know how to create a <b>div</b>, a <b>span</b>, a <b>link</b>, a <b>button</b>, and a <b>text input</b> field</li>
				<li><strong>CSS:</strong><br>You know how to style things with an <b>id</b> or a <b>class</b></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				If not, take some time to practice those things, and then come back.  This course will be here for you when you're ready.
			</p>
		</div>



		<div class="section">
			<h2>What you'll learn</h2>

			<p>JavaScript lets you add interactivity to your pages.</p>

			<p>Here are some examples of things you can do with JavaScript:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Showing and hiding things when users click</li>
				<li>Validating forms</li>
				<li>Changing styles dynamically</li>
				<li>Responding to user actions</li>
				<li>Interactive games</li>
				<li>Countdown clocks</li>
				<li>Calculation helpers</li>
				<li>Much more stuff than I can list</li>
			</ul>
		</div>



		<div class="section">
			<h2>Tools you'll use</h2>

			<h3>What you'll need:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A text editor (I personally prefer Sublime Text, a free download, but feel free to use whatever you want.)</li>
				<li>A browser</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Why those tools?</h3>
			<p>
				A lot of courses have their own editors where you learn directly on their site.  This is great for convenience, but afterwards, many people say that they don't know how to apply their knowledge in real situations.
			</p>

			<p>
				This course won't let that happen to you.
			</p>

			<p>
				In order to get used to coding in real life, it's best for your practice to match real conditions as much as possible.
			</p>

			<p>
				That means you'll be using your own text editor, and you'll be testing your code in your own browser.
			</p>

			<p>
				This way, you won't feel lost when the time comes to code in real life because you've been practicing under real conditions all along.
			</p>

			<h2>How you'll learn:<br>The Simple Steps Method</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Practical usefulness comes first</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>A lot of courses and books make you slog through a ton of theory before you get to do anything practical, but not this course.</li>
						<li>This course is structured so that you get to do as many practical, useful things as soon as possible while still getting the theory you need.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Learn small pieces at a time</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>I’d rather tell you one thing and have you remember it than 10 things and have you forget all of them.</li>
						<li>You'll keep more excitement and momentum this way, and that will make you learn faster.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h3>Practice small pieces of code until they feel automatic and easy</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>You'll actually have to type the code to remember it well.  That's important.  The concepts in each section build on one another, so <strong>10 extra minutes of practice now can save you 3 hours of confusion later</strong>.</li>
						<li>The course is structured so you'll spend more time actually coding than reading.</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="special_section warning">
						<h2>Warning: Don't trick yourself</h2>
						<p>Don’t just stop when you understand a concept, as that’s the number 1 way to forget it.</p>
						<p>Keep practicing until it's easy.</p>
						<p>The course is structured so this happens automatically as long as you do the exercises.</p>
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Enjoy yourself</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Each section is a fun new skill you get to try out, so don’t treat it like work.</li>
						<li>If I ask you to repeat some code, maybe put on some music (and even a timer) and have fun with it.</li>
						<li>Don't be afraid to learn new things.  Every big concept is just a bunch of smaller concepts put together.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
