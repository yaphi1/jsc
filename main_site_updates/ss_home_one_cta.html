	<p>
		Hi! I'm a front-end developer by the name of Yaphi.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a mostly self-taught coder, I've had these frustrations too.  I eventually realized that a lot of people make web development sound more complicated than it needs to be.
	</p>
	<p>
		I created a <b>front-end development roadmap</b> so you can stop feeling lost, learn what you need to learn, and get paid to do what you love.
	</p>
	<!-- <h1>
		When it comes to <span>front-end web development</span>, there's a ton of information, and not enough direction.
	</h1>

	<p>
		People say you need to know <span>a mountain of different languages and frameworks</span>, but is it really true?
	</p>

	<p>
		You're prepared to put in the work, but you're <span>terrified of wasting years learning the wrong things</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		You often find yourself wishing for a <span>road map</span> that could could just cut through the noise and <span>show you what to do next</span>.
	</p>

	<p>
		As a mostly self-taught front-end developer, I've had these frustrations too.  I eventually found that a lot of devs make it sound more forbidding than it needs to sound.  I created a front-end development roadmap so you won't have to struggle the way I did.

<!-- 

Motivation is not the problem.  You just want to be pointed in the right direction.

Getting into front-end web development doesn't need to feel so overwhelming.

Front-end web development is 

Empathetic opening
	- You know some HTML and CSS but now what?
	- Want to be front-end web developer or boost skills
	- Everyone says you need to know all these different frameworks and stuff; it's so overwhelming
	- Easy to feel lost
	- Too much info, not enough direction
	- You wish you had a roadmap so you could know what to do next, what to avoid, how to not waste time, etc
	- Here's your roadmap
